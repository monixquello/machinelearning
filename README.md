Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic based on clinical and lifestyle features. It includes:
    > Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    > Data preprocessing and feature encoding
    > Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest
    > Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
    > Feature importance analysis
